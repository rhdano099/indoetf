"""
Pulls daily close prices for the 98 NSE ETFs used in the Bhavcopy heatmap and writes
data/etf-history.json in the shape the heatmap's "Connect live data" loader expects:

    { "SYMBOL": [["YYYY-MM-DD", price], ...], ... }

Run locally with:  python3 scripts/fetch_etf_data.py
Runs automatically via .github/workflows/update-data.yml on a daily schedule.

No API key needed — yfinance reads Yahoo Finance's public endpoints.

Fetched with yf.download() in small batches, not one yf.Ticker(...).history() call per
symbol — every single-ticker Ticker.history() fetch in this project has ended up hitting
Yahoo's rate limit hard on GitHub's runner IPs (this same site's Nifty 500 index price,
Nifty Smallcap 250 index price, and the original version of this exact script all hit it),
while yf.download()'s batched endpoint has consistently held up. Small batches + no
threading + pauses between them is what keeps this reliable — see fetch_global_etf_data.py
for the same pattern.

Merges into the PREVIOUSLY COMMITTED data/etf-history.json instead of overwriting it from
scratch. Yahoo's batched download endpoint occasionally comes back with a NaN close for
one ticker on one specific day even though the rest of the batch (and that same ticker on
every other day) is fine -- a transient per-symbol glitch, not a real market closure.
Overwriting from scratch every run means that single bad day is gone for good the moment
it happens, with no way to recover it: the site's "1D" change then has to either fudge the
comparison across a multi-day gap, or show "no data" for that ticker until the SAME day
happens to fetch cleanly on some future run (never, if the gap is a stale, permanently-bad
date rather than "yesterday"). Merging means a transient gap in today's fetch doesn't
erase a date a previous run already captured, and a date that failed before but fetches
cleanly today gets backfilled in automatically -- self-healing across runs instead of
each run being an independent all-or-nothing snapshot.
